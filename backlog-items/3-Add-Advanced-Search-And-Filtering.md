# Add Advanced Search and Filtering

## User Story
As a **customer**,
I want to **search and filter products easily**,
So that **I can quickly find products that match my specific needs and preferences**.

## Description
The current product catalog only supports basic pagination. Customers need robust search functionality and filtering options to navigate the growing product inventory effectively.

## Epic Breakdown
This story is part of the "Enhanced Product Discovery" epic, which includes:
- Advanced search (this story)
- Product recommendations (DEMO-105)
- Recently viewed products (DEMO-106)
- Wishlist functionality (DEMO-107)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Search Suggestions**: Auto-complete suggestions as user types
- [ ] **Search History**: Remember user's recent searches (logged-in users)
- [ ] **Search Analytics**: Track popular search terms for business insights
- [ ] **No Results Handling**: Suggest alternative products when no matches found

### Filter Options
- [ ] **Category Filter**: Filter by product categories (electronics, clothing, etc.)

- [ ] **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently
- [ ] **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for mobile filters
- [ ] **Caching**: Cache popular search results

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Enhancements

#### Search Endpoint
```javascript
GET /api/products/search?q={query}&category={cat}&minPrice={min}&maxPrice={max}&brand={brand}&rating={min_rating}&sort={field}&order={asc|desc}&page={num}&limit={num}
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "products": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalItems": 48,
    "itemsPerPage": 10
  },
  "filters": {
    "appliedFilters": {...},
    "availableFilters": {
      "categories": ["electronics", "clothing"],
      "brands": ["Apple", "Samsung"],
      "priceRange": { "min": 10, "max": 1000 }
    }
  },
  "searchMeta": {
    "query": "laptop",
    "executionTime": "45ms",
    "totalResults": 48
  }
}
```

### Database Optimizations

#### Search Indexes
```javascript
// Text search index
db.products.createIndex({
  "name": "text",
  "description": "text", 
  "tags": "text"
});

// Compound indexes for filtering
db.products.createIndex({ "category": 1, "price": 1 });
db.products.createIndex({ "brand": 1, "rating.average": -1 });
db.products.createIndex({ "isActive": 1, "stock": 1 });
```

#### Search Aggregation Pipeline
```javascript
const searchPipeline = [
  // Match stage with filters
  { $match: buildFilterQuery(filters) },
  
  // Add search score for text queries
  { $addFields: { 
    searchScore: { $meta: "textScore" } 
  }},
  
  // Sort by relevance or specified field
  { $sort: buildSortQuery(sortBy, sortOrder) },
  
  // Pagination
  { $skip: (page - 1) * limit },
  { $limit: limit },
  
  // Shape output
  { $project: { 
    name: 1, 
    price: 1, 
    category: 1,
    rating: 1,
    images: { $slice: ["$images", 1] },
    searchScore: 1
  }}
];
```

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/routes/products.js` - Add search endpoint
- `src/services/SearchService.js` - Search business logic
- `src/utils/QueryBuilder.js` - Build MongoDB queries
- `src/middleware/searchValidation.js` - Validate search parameters
- Database migration for indexes

## AI-Assisted Development

### AI Prompts for Implementation
1. **Search Algorithm**: "Create an efficient product search algorithm that handles text search, filters, and sorting for an e-commerce API"

2. **Query Optimization**: "Optimize this MongoDB aggregation pipeline for product search performance"

3. **Edge Cases**: "What edge cases should I test for e-commerce product search functionality?"

4. **Security**: "What security considerations are important for search endpoints?"

### AI Development Workflow
```bash
# Pull issue with imdone-cli
imdone pull

# Use AI for architecture planning
# Ask: "Design a scalable search API structure for this e-commerce requirement"

# Generate boilerplate code with AI
# Ask: "Create a SearchService class with these requirements"

# Optimize with AI suggestions
# Ask: "Review this search implementation for performance issues"

# Update issue status and push changes
imdone push
```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Search Flow
1. Customer visits product catalog
2. Types "wireless headphones" in search box
3. Sees auto-suggestions while typing
4. Selects suggestion or presses enter
5. Results show filtered products with search highlights

### Scenario 2: Advanced Filtering
1. Customer searches for "laptop"
2. Applies filters: Category=Electronics, Price=$500-$1500, Brand=Apple
3. Sorts by "Price: Low to High"
4. Sees 12 matching MacBook models
5. Refines search with "13 inch" to narrow results

### Scenario 3: No Results Recovery
1. Customer searches for "xyz123" (no matches)
2. System suggests: "Did you mean 'laptop'?"
3. Shows popular products in similar categories
4. Provides search tips and category browsing options
