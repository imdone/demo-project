- [ ] `GET /api/recommendations/product/:productId/similar` - Similar products
- [ ] `GET /api/recommendations/trending` - Trending products
- [ ] `POST /api/recommendations/feedback` - Track recommendation clicks/purchases

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Response Time**: < 200ms for recommendation API calls
- [ ] **Accuracy**: > 15% click-through rate on recommendations
- [ ] **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent recommendation requests
- [ ] **Data Processing**: Process user interactions in near real-time

## Technical Architecture

### Machine Learning Pipeline
```python
# Pseudo-code for recommendation algorithm
class RecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collaborative_filter = CollaborativeFilter()
        self.content_filter = ContentBasedFilter()
        self.trending_calculator = TrendingCalculator()
    
    def get_recommendations(self, user_id, limit=10):
        # Combine multiple recommendation strategies
        collaborative_recs = self.collaborative_filter.recommend(user_id, limit//2)
        content_recs = self.content_filter.recommend(user_id, limit//2)
        
        # Merge and rank recommendations
        return self.merge_and_rank(collaborative_recs, content_recs)
```

### Data Models
```javascript
// User Interaction Tracking
const userInteractionSchema = {
  userId: ObjectId,
  productId: ObjectId,
  interactionType: String, // 'view', 'cart', 'purchase', 'like'
  timestamp: Date,
  sessionId: String,
  metadata: {
    timeSpent: Number,
    source: String, // 'search', 'category', 'recommendation'
  }
};

// Recommendation Cache
const recommendationCacheSchema = {
  userId: ObjectId,
  recommendations: [{
    productId: ObjectId,
    score: Number,
    reason: String, // 'similar_purchase', 'trending', 'content_match'
    generatedAt: Date
  }],
  expiresAt: Date
};
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic collaborative filtering with purchase data
2. **Phase 2**: Add content-based filtering using product attributes
3. **Phase 3**: Implement real-time interaction tracking
4. **Phase 4**: Add trending/popular product recommendations
5. **Phase 5**: Optimize with advanced ML algorithms

## AI-Assisted Development Opportunities

### AI Prompts for Implementation
1. **Algorithm Design**: "Design a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative and content-based filtering for an e-commerce platform"

2. **Code Generation**: "Create a Python class for collaborative filtering using cosine similarity for product recommendations"

3. **Data Analysis**: "Analyze this user interaction data and suggest the best features for product recommendations"

4. **Performance Optimization**: "Optimize this recommendation algorithm for real-time performance with 10,000+ products"

### ML Model Development with AI
```bash
# Use AI to help with ML pipeline
# Prompt: "Create a recommendation model training pipeline using this user-item interaction data"

# AI can help with:
# - Feature engineering suggestions
# - Algorithm selection and tuning
# - Data preprocessing pipelines
# - Model evaluation metrics
# - A/B testing strategies
```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Recommendations
1. User creates account (no purchase history)
2. System shows trending products and category-based suggestions
3. User views several electronics products
4. Recommendations update to show similar electronics
5. Demonstrates cold-start problem solution

### Scenario 2: Returning Customer
1. Returning customer with purchase history logs in
2. Homepage shows "Recommended for you" section
3. Product pages show "Customers who bought this also bought"
4. Demonstrates personalization based on past behavior

### Scenario 3: Real-time Adaptation
1. Customer browses fitness equipment
2. Adds yoga mat to cart
3. Recommendations immediately update to show related fitness gear
4. Demonstrates real-time recommendation updates
